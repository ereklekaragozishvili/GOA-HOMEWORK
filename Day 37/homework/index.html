                        Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around 
                        scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the 
                        Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie

                        to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The 
                        Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.</i></p>
